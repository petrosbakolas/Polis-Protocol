The same gathering that once debated policy in the Agora became the center of both spiritual and civic life. Unity of purpose. Community self-governance continued.\n\nThe Eastern Roman Empire—what the West dismissively calls \"Byzantium\"—was built on self-governed villages and cities. The Emperor's reach stopped at the boundaries of the Ekklisia. Local communities managed their own affairs, made their own decisions, maintained their own justice.\n\nEven under Ottoman rule, this model persisted. The conquerors didn't impose a new system—they adopted ours. Self-governed communities continued for four centuries. The Ottomans involved themselves only in taxation and army recruitment. Everything else remained in the hands of the people.\n\nFor 2,500 years, Greeks lived democracy. Not perfectly. Not without interruption. But continuously."

Instead, we got parliaments, parties, and the slow erosion of civic participation."
